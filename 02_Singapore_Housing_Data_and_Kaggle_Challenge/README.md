### Introduction & Problem Statement

Predicting HDB resale prices is vital for homeowners, buyers, and agents. An app with customizable parameters can offer valuable insights. For instance, the Tan family, with a child and considering upgrading from a 3-room to a 5-room flat, seeks fair market rates. By inputting criteria like flat type, preferred location, floor area, and lease commencement date, they can obtain accurate resale price predictions. This empowers them to make informed decisions, understand market dynamics, and navigate the buying and selling process confidently. Such tools cater to diverse stakeholders and enhance transparency in the housing market, ensuring fair deals for all parties involved.

The problem statement is:
**<center>How might we develop a platform for predicting HDB resale flat prices based on preferences, streamlining price comparison process for sellers and buyers, and attracting users to our platform?</center>**

The primary audience will be the executive members of Propertee Guru, with the app targeting the home buyers and sellers.

### Model Evaluation

Success of the model will be determined by the Root Mean Square Error of the model and the R2 scores. The lower the RMSE, the better it is at predicting the resale price of a flat given the factors. A higher R2 scores indicates a better fit of the model.

We can say that all the models performed quite well, with R2 values around 0.87. Additionally, the difference between the train and test R2 values are small from 0.0007 (0.08%) to 0.0012 (0.14%). The difference between the train and test Root Mean Square Error values are small too. The results are as follows:

| Regression Type              | Train R2 | Test R2 | Train Root Mean Square Error | Test Root Mean Square Error |
|------------------------------|----------|---------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Linear Regression            | 0.8737   | 0.8727  | 50,990.87                    | 50,938.45                   |
| Lasso Regression             | 0.8718   | 0.8711  | 51,378.28                    | 51,248.59                   |
| Ridge Regression             | 0.8740   | 0.8728  | 50,941.09                    | 50,908.12                   |
| Ridge Regression (hypertuned)| 0.8740   | 0.8728  | 50,941.13                    | 50,908.00                   |


Overall, the ridge regression model has the best performance in terms of R2 score and Root Mean Squared Error. Regularisation enhanced the model predictive performance. When it comes to the submission to Kaggle, I will be using the ridge regression after hyperparameter.

We managed to create a strong model with an R2 value of 0.8740, which means that 87.4% of the variation of the resale price of an HDB flat can be explained by our model. Also, our Root Mean Square Error is approximately 50,900. This means that on average, our predicted price can vary from the actual price by $50,900.

### Conclusion and Recommendations
We recommend the Tan family to buy 4 room flat in Queenstown at around S$ 500,000. With the application, we can get more accurate market price instead of viewing the average price. This application can help sellers determine suitable selling price. Setting it too high might take a longer time to sell the unit. Setting it too low does not help the seller to earn profits. Additionally, it can help buyers minimise cost. This is so that buyers can avoid Cash on Valuation.

Data features that we would have liked to have collected to determine even more accurate HDB resale flat prices:
- Areas demarcated by MRT station names
- Distance to fitness areas
- Distance to parks
- Spike in prices from 2022
